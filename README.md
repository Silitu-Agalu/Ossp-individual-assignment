# Arch Linux – Operating System Project
Arch Linux is a minimal and highly customizable Linux distribution. To install it, I used Vmware workstation  with at least 2GB RAM and 20GB storage. The process included mounting the ISO, setting up partitions, and installing the base system using terminal commands. I also configured the bootloader and basic system settings manually. This installation gives a deeper understanding of how Linux systems work behind the scenes.
SYSTEM CALL – pipe()
The pipe() system call is used to allow two processes to communicate. It creates a one-way data stream between a reader and a writer process. This is commonly used in Linux commands like ls | grep. In Arch Linux, pipe() is part of core process communication. It helps programs work together efficiently by sharing data.
